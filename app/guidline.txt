Django app -step by step

1. create new app with command - startapp 'name'
2. register the app in settings: INSTALLED_APPS = []
3. add postgreSQL as DB
3.5. install psycopg2
4. create Packages : views and forms in the new app
7. in the views we create functions with the program logic
6. in app/urls - create urlpatterns = (
    # Index
    path('', index, name='index'), for each function in the views
5. In the main directory urls add     path('', include('app.urls'))

) - for each view we have to have a path for ex, edit , delete, create

8. The forms contain information about the fields that the user have to fill in:
class ExpenseForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Expense
        exclude = ('profile',)
9. in de models we have the configuration about the fields itself:
    class Expense(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        image_url = models.URLField()
        description = models.TextField()
        price = models.FloatField()
        profile = models.ForeignKey(Profile, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
10. v admin we register our models:
admin.site.register(Expense)
admin.site.register(Profile)
11. evey changes in models.py should be migrate with makemigration and migrate commands
